# üìä Predict Open Price

A time series forecasting project focused on predicting stock **open prices** using machine learning and deep learning models.

## üß† Project Overview
This repository demonstrates a full pipeline for financial time series modeling. It includes everything from raw data processing to model evaluation and visualization. The primary goal is to predict future **open prices** of financial instruments based on historical patterns.

Key components of the project:
- üìÇ Data loading, preprocessing, and cleaning (incl. outlier removal)
- üìâ Feature engineering & scaling
- üîç Time series modeling using regression and neural networks
